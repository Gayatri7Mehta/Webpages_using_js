    <h1>Types Of Circuits</h1>
    <br>
    <h3>Open Circits</h3>
    <p>
        When there is a break or gap in an electric circuit which disallow the flow of current through the circuit is known as open circuit.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Closed Circuits</h3>
    <p>
        An electric circuit is said to be closed if there is continuous path from the energy source to the load. Thus, an electric circuit which has a closed loop path to flow of current from source to load is called a closed circuit.
